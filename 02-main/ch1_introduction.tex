Bitcoin is a decentralized peer-to-peer currency that allows users to pay for
things electronically. Thousands of other cryptocurrencies exist, but only some
of them are really interesting from a political, economical or technical point
of view. Bitcoin was created by a pseudonymous software developer going by the
name of Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, as an electronic payment system based on
mathematical proof. The idea was to produce a means of exchange, independent of
any central authority and censorship-resistant, which could be transferred
electronically in a secure, verifiable and immutable way. The blockchain is the
output of this secure, verifiable and immutable mathematical proof.
