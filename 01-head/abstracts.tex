Today, blockchain has become an ever-growing instrument for designing and developing secure exchange systems between multiple parties, especially where
traditional payment systems reach limitations. As the growth of multilateral trade and globalization increases, the need for a security tool to settle various
currencies is becoming more critical. Blockchain-based exchange address one of these limitations, where this solution allows us to create a virtual currency (cryptocurrency)
to settle transactions between pairs of national currencies. This project aims to demonstrate the current settlement process between national currencies and
propose a suited blockchain-based solution by creating a virtual currency (cryptocurrency). For the project and to have a proof-of-concept,
a simulation of trade between the US dollar and the created virtual currency will be implemented. The goal of this project is to create an automated and secure blockchain-based
inter-currency settlement platform, which will be able to exchange our new cryptocurrency with other currencies.
